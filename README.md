# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

I used the start codes from forked repo to design this simple clone. Users can see all the tweets and create new tweets as well. I also follow the responsive design to make the application fit for different sizes of screens. 

## Getting Started

1. Fork this repository, then clone your fork of this repository.
2. Install dependencies using the `npm install` command.
3. Start the web server using the `npm run local` command. The app will be served at <http://localhost:8080/>.
4. Go to <http://localhost:8080/> in your browser.

## Dependencies

- Express
- Node 5.10.x or above

## Screenshots and function demonstration
!["login page"](https://github.com/spiritxhx/tweeter/blob/master/docs/loginPage.png)
In the login page, we have showed all the tweets in our database, by creation time descending. 


!["create new tweets"](https://github.com/spiritxhx/tweeter/blob/master/docs/newTweets.png)
In create new tweets section, we have a "tweet" button and a counter to count the text length of input, and when the input is not valid, an error will pop up on the screen. 


!["responsive design"](https://github.com/spiritxhx/tweeter/blob/master/docs/responsiveDesign.png)
In this page, we can see clearly that this website has a responsive design and the layout in smaller screen(lower resolution screen) is different and more straight forward.
